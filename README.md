# biofarm
 Test project for a selection process at Biofarm.

The SQL File is in /biofarm/src/app/Config/

In the same folder there is a database config file and a general config file. To install the project into a folder, not at in the root of your server, just define USE_BASE_FOLDER as true, on line 14.

And, to see possible errors while using the project, change DEBUG from false to true, on line 25.

The login and password of the user already created are teste@biofarm.com.br and adminbiofarm2021

Thanks.
